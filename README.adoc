link:{upstream-url}[{upstream-name}] is an application that works
with GitLab CI/CD to run jobs in a pipeline.

You can choose to install the GitLab Runner application on infrastructure that
you own or manage. If you do, you should install GitLab Runner on a machine
thatâ€™s separate from the one that hosts the GitLab instance for security and
performance reasons. When you use separate machines, you can have different
operating systems and tools, like Kubernetes or Docker, on each.

GitLab Runner is open-source and written in Go. It can be run as a single
binary; no language-specific requirements are needed.

You can install GitLab Runner on several different supported operating systems.
Other operating systems may also work, as long as you can compile a Go binary on
them.

GitLab Runner can also run inside a Docker container or be deployed into a
Kubernetes cluster.

[NOTE]
Only Windows versions with active support from Microsoft are working.
https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows.html#windows-version-support-policy[
See Windows support policies] for more information.

== Status
This PortableApps project is in beta stage.

Currently the only type of runner tested and supported is the shell executor
with PowerShell as the shell.

== Runner registration

Besides the main application __Gitlab Runner__ there is also the __Gitlab Runner
Register__ executable which opens a terminal window running gitlab-runner with
the `register` keyword.

Follow the official link https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/ to find out
how to add your Portable Gitlab Runner to one or multiple instances.

After registration the `config.toml` file is stored under
`{app-name}\Data\gitlab-runner`.

== Troubleshooting

If things go pear shaped one can run the __Gitlab Runner Shell__ command which
opens a terminal session with the `gitlab-runner.exe` binary in its path.

.Output for `gitlab-runner help` from within the __Gitlab Runner Shell__

== Installation

=== Download

Since this is not an official PortableApp the PortableApps installer must
be download first. Navigate to https://github.com/uroesch/{app-name}/releases
for a selection of releases.

=== Install via the PortableApps.com Platform

After downloading the `.paf.exe` installer navigate to your PortableApps.com
platform `Apps` Menu &#10102; and select `Install a new app (paf.exe)` &#10103;.


image:install_newapp_menu.png[width="400"]

From the dialog choose the previously downloaded `.paf.exe` file. &#10104;

image:install_newapp_dialog.png[width="400"]

After a short while the installation dialog will appear.

=== Install outside of the PortableApps.com Platform

The Packages found under the release page are not digitally signed so there the
installation is a bit involved.

After downloading the `.paf.exe` installer trying to install may result in a
windows defender warning.

To unblock the installer and install the application follow the annotated
screenshot below.
